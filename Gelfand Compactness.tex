\section*{Introduction}


Galois categories were introduced by Grothendieck in \cite{grothendieck1971revetement} to create a fundamental group of a scheme. A comprehensive approach can be found in the paper of Cadoret \cite{cadoret2013galois}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Preliminaries}

We denote by $\mathcal{S}_f$ the category of finite sets.

We denote by $\Delta$ the simplex category and by $s\mathcal{S}$ the category of simplicial sets.

\section{Simplicial Coverings}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a simplicial set. A simplicial covering of $X$ is a pair $(Y,p)$ where $Y$ is a simplicial set and $p\colon Y\longrightarrow X$ is asimplicial map such that...
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $X$ be a simplicial set and  $(Y,p)$ a simplicial covering of $X$. Then $(\vert Y\vert,\vert p\vert)$ is covering of $\vert X\vert$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

\section{Simplicial Galois Category}

\begin{definition}[Galois Category]
A Galois category is a pair $(\mathcal{C},F)$ where $\mathcal{C}$ is a category and $F\colon \mathcal{C}\longrightarrow \mathcal{S}_f$, and satisfy the following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}[{GC}1)]
\item $\mathcal{C}$ is finitely complete.
\item $\mathcal{C}$ has finite coproducts and categorical quotients by groups of automorphisms.
\item Any morphism $f\colon A\longrightarrow B$ factors as $f''f'$ where $f'$ is a strict epimorphism and $f''$ is a split monomoprhism.
\item $F$ commutes with finite limits.
\item $F$ commutes with finite coproducts and categorical quotients by groups of automorphisms, and sends strict epimorphisms to strict epimorphisms.
\item $F$ reflects isomorphisms.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
